#Introduction

**Note**: If you press 'CTRL' button while clicking the links in the WIKI, it will open the link in a new page/tab.

This WIKI contains the knowledge which I find useful for the speech signal processing research. The main contents include:

1. [Tools for efficient scientific research](#docs/tools)

2. Background knowledge

3. Datasets

4. Reading notes

3. Toolboxes, codes of published papers

3. List of famous groups, conferences and journals

To edit the content in the WIKI, you may refer to [How to use markdown?](http://wowubuntu.com/markdown/) for the syntax of the markdown language.

Please do NOT edit the WIKI in the Internet browser. This WIKI is also a git repository, therefore the suggested way to update this WIKI is through Git. You can clone it, edit it locally, add images or any other file type, and push it back. It will be live immediately. 

Go ahead and try:

```
$ git clone https://hustxuewei@bitbucket.org/hustxuewei/wiki.git/wiki
```
Wiki pages are normal files, with the .md extension. You can edit them locally, as well as creating new ones.

To learn how to use the git, please read [All about git](Guidence_to_github.md) in "Tools for efficient scientific research".
